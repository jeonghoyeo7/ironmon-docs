The IronMON experience is designed to be intuitive and engaging. Below is the step-by-step journey for users interacting with the platform:

1. **Visit the [IronMON Website](https://testnet.ironmon.fun)**
   - Upon arrival, users see:
     - A list of available dApps with titles and descriptions.
     - A silhouette of the robot NFT they can mint.
     - The total number of NFTs minted so far.
   - Without a wallet connected, no personal dApp usage data is visible.

2. **Connect a Wallet**
   - Users connect a supported wallet (e.g., OKX, MetaMask).
   - Once connected:
     - The site displays which dApps the user has interacted with.
     - Eligible robot components become selectable (highlighted via buttons or the robot silhouette).

3. **Select dApps for Robot Components**
   - Users choose dApps theyâ€™ve used to assign components (e.g., head, body) for their NFT.
   - After selection, the corresponding component images are revealed.

4. **Preview the Robot NFT**
   - As components are selected, a preview of the robot NFT is displayed.
     - If not all dApps in a category are used, the component appears in black-and-white.

5. **Mint the NFT**
   - Users pay 0.1 MON to mint their robot NFT.
   - For a user, duplicate dApp combinations cannot be minted again.
