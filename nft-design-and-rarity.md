# NFT Design and Rarity

Robot NFTs in IronMON are built from modular components tied to dApp usage, with rarity levels based on engagement:

- **Components**: Head, Body, Arms, Legs, Accessory.
- **Rarity Levels**:
  - **Black-and-White Robot**: If a user hasn’t used all dApps in a component’s category, that component is grayscale.
  - **Colored Robot**: Using all dApps in a category unlocks a colored version of that component.
  - **Easter Egg**: Explore to unlock a colored background!
- **Design Consistency**: Components are designed to seamlessly combine, reflecting the style of their associated dApps.
